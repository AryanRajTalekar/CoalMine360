            <h2>What is Hydropower?</h2>
            <p>
                Hydropower, or hydroelectric power, is the generation of electricity by harnessing the energy of flowing or falling water. This energy is captured using turbines and converted into electrical energy. Hydropower is one of the oldest and most widely used renewable energy sources, leveraging the kinetic energy of water to produce clean electricity.

            <h2>How Hydropower Reduces Electricity Consumption</h2>
            <p>
                Hydropower offers a sustainable alternative to traditional electricity generation methods that depend on fossil fuels. By utilizing the natural flow of water to generate electricity, hydropower reduces the need for burning fossil fuels, which in turn lowers greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hydropower systems, such as dams and run-of-river setups, can provide a stable and reliable source of electricity, which reduces the reliance on non-renewable energy sources from the grid. This not only decreases the overall consumption of traditional electricity but also helps in stabilizing energy prices and enhancing energy security.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moreover, hydropower plants can store energy in the form of water in reservoirs. This stored energy can be used during periods of high demand, ensuring a consistent energy supply and further reducing the need for supplementary electricity from less sustainable sources.
