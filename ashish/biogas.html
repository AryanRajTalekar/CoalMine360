        <h2>What is a Biogas Plant?</h2>
        <p>
          A biogas plant is a facility that produces biogas through the anaerobic digestion of organic materials such as agricultural waste, manure, and food scraps. The biogas generated consists mainly of methane and carbon dioxide, which can be used for energy production, heating, and as a vehicle fuel.
        </p>
        
        <h2>How Biogas Plants Reduce Carbon Emissions</h2>
        <p>
          By converting organic waste into biogas, biogas plants reduce reliance on fossil fuels and help lower greenhouse gas emissions. The methane captured can replace natural gas in energy production, significantly reducing the carbon footprint associated with energy use.
        </p>

        <h2>Steps Involved in Biogas Production</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Collection of Feedstock:</strong> Organic materials such as agricultural waste, food scraps, or manure are collected.</li>
          <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Feedstock is prepared and sometimes shredded to improve digestion efficiency.</li>
          <li><strong>Anaerobic Digestion:</strong> Feedstock is placed in an anaerobic digester where microorganisms break it down in the absence of oxygen, producing biogas.</li>
          <li><strong>Gas Collection:</strong> Biogas is collected from the digester and stored in a gas holder.</li>
          <li><strong>Energy Conversion:</strong> The collected biogas is used to generate electricity, provide heat, or as a fuel for vehicles.</li>
          <li><strong>Digestate Management:</strong> The remaining digestate (solid and liquid) can be used as a high-quality fertilizer for agriculture.</li>
