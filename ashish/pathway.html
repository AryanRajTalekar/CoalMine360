        <h2>Electric Vehicle</h2>
        <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) reduce carbon emissions by using electricity instead of gasoline, leading to zero tailpipe emissions. Their environmental impact depends on how the electricity is generated. As more renewable energy sources are integrated into the grid, the carbon footprint of EVs continues to decrease, aiding in climate change mitigation.</p>

        <h2>Biogas Plant</h2>
        <p>Biogas is a renewable energy source produced from the anaerobic digestion of organic materials, such as agricultural waste, manure, and food scraps. It primarily consists of methane and carbon dioxide. As a clean energy alternative, biogas can be used for electricity generation, heating, and even as a vehicle fuel, helping to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and lower greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, its production helps manage waste and reduces environmental pollution.</p>

        <h2>Solar Energy</h2>
        <p>Solar energy reduces direct electricity consumption by powering homes and appliances with photovoltaic panels, heating water and air through solar thermal systems, and providing energy for solar-powered devices. These uses cut reliance on grid electricity, lower energy bills, and decrease carbon footprints.</p>

        <h2>Wind Energy</h2>
        <p>Wind energy harnesses the power of wind using turbines to generate electricity. As wind turns the turbine blades, the mechanical energy is converted into electrical power. This clean, renewable energy source reduces dependence on fossil fuels, lowers greenhouse gas emissions, and provides a sustainable alternative for electricity generation.</p>

        <h2>Hydropower</h2>
        <p>Hydropower generates electricity by harnessing the energy of flowing or falling water. Water flow drives turbines connected to generators, converting kinetic energy into electrical power. As a renewable and reliable energy source, hydropower reduces reliance on fossil fuels and minimizes greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to cleaner energy production.</p>

        <h2>Geothermal Energy</h2>
        <p>Geothermal energy utilizes the Earth's internal heat to generate electricity or provide heating. By tapping into hot water and steam reservoirs beneath the Earth's surface, geothermal plants drive turbines to produce power, or direct heat for buildings. It offers a sustainable, low-emission energy source with consistent availability.</p>

        <h2>Ocean Energy</h2>
        <p>Ocean energy harnesses the power of ocean movements, including tides, waves, and thermal gradients, to generate electricity. Technologies like tidal turbines, wave energy converters, and ocean thermal energy systems capture and convert these natural forces into usable power. It provides a reliable, renewable energy source with minimal environmental impact.</p>
